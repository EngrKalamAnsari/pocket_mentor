# Pocket Mentor (Lessons Creator) App

A compact Rails application that provides **personalized micro-lessons and quizzes** to users based on their goals (programming, music, languages, etc.). The app demonstrates authentication, AI integration, service-oriented architecture, and responsive design using Bootstrap.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Devise Setup used, Sign up, log in, and manage personalized lessons.
- **Personalized Lessons**: AI-generated content tailored to the user's level and interests.
- **Short Quizzes**: Each lesson comes with a set of quiz questions generated by AI.
- **Service-Oriented Architecture**: AI API calls are encapsulated in services for clean controllers.
- **Responsive Design**: UI styled using **Bootstrap** for mobile-friendly layouts.
- **Error Handling & Caching**: Handles AI API errors gracefully and uses caching to optimize performance.
- **Test Stubs**: Includes stubs/mocks for AI API to enable testing without consuming API calls.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Ruby on Rails 8
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap 5
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **AI Integration**: Groq API
- **Authentication**: Devise (or your chosen auth gem)
- **Architecture**: Services to handle AI calls and business logic

## How It Works

1. User signs up and selects their learning goals.
2. When creating a new lesson, the app calls the **Groq API** via a service object.
3. The API generates:
   - Lesson content tailored to the user's level.
   - Short quiz questions related to the lesson.
4. The controller receives the response, saves the lesson, and renders it for the user.
5. Error handling ensures that empty or invalid AI responses are gracefully managed.
